Key insights include:

Average ratings across feedback categories 📈
Top strengths and areas needing attention 🔍
Correlation of each factor with course recommendation likelihood 💡
Comparative profiles of high vs. low recommenders 🆚
The analysis culminates in clear, actionable recommendations 🛠️—empowering educators and academic leaders to enhance student engagement, refine instructional strategies, and foster a more supportive learning environment ✨.
